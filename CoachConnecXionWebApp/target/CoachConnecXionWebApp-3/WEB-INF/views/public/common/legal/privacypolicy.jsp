<p align=center style='text-align:center'><b><span style='color:black'>PRIVACY
POLICY</span></b></p><br>

<p><span style='color:black'>We know that you buy our products and services and
use our Website because you trust us. This notice explains how we protect your
privacy and treat your personal information. It applies to current and former
customers. &quot;Personal information&quot; here means anything we know about
you personally.</span></p><br>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>Protecting Your Information</span></b></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>We take important steps to protect your personal
information. We treat it as confidential. We tell our employees to take care in
handling it. We limit access to those who need it to perform their jobs. Our
outside service providers must also protect it, and use it only to meet our
business needs. We also take steps to protect our systems from unauthorized
access. We comply with all laws that apply to us.</span></p><br>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>Collecting Your Information</span></b></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>The types of Personal Information we collect and
share depend on the product or service you have with us. The type of
information that we currently collect is used primarily to identify you as a
valid user to our system, and to facilitate the payment process, and the
interaction between coaches, and those seeking to be coached.  Currently we
collect and save the following personal information:</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>Name, Address, City, State,
Zipcode, Country, Phone Number, Email </span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>&nbsp;</span></p>

<p class=MsoNormal><span style='color:black'>We also collect credit card
information for payment purposes only, but that information is never saved in
our system.  </span></p><br>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>How We Get Your Information</span></b></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>We get your personal information mostly from you.
We may also use outside sources to help ensure our records are correct and
complete.</span></p><br>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>Using Your Information</span></b></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>We do not make available to the general public any
personally identifiable information you provide to us in connection with your
registration on the Website. We use industry standard technology and efforts to
safeguard the confidentiality of your personal information. These include
secure servers and firewalls. All of the user data we collect is protected
against unauthorized access. Only authorized employees who need the information
to perform a specific job are granted access to this information.</span></p><br>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>Information Sharing</span></b></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>We will not share your information with
unaffiliated companies for their own marketing purposes without a joint
marketing arrangement. </span></p><br>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>Non-Personal User Content</span></b></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>Owner may use user submitted content such as
ratings, reviews, feedback (&quot;User Content&quot;) in a number of different
ways, including displaying it on the Website, reformatting it, incorporating it
into other works, creating derivative works from it, promoting it, or
distributing it. Accordingly, you irrevocably grant Owner permission to use
your User Content for any purpose. You also irrevocably grant the Website users
the right to access User Content in connection with their use of the Website.</span></p><br>

<p><span style='color:black'>You assume all risks associated with User Content,
including reliance on its accuracy, completeness or usefulness, or any
disclosure by you of information in your User Content that makes you personally
identifiable. You may not imply that User Content is in any way sponsored or
endorsed by Owner.</span></p><br>

<p><span style='color:black'>Owner cannot and does not review all User Content
feedback, nor does it have any control over the same. Under no circumstances
shall Owner be held responsible or liable for any claims or damages arising out
of any reviews or feedback.</span></p><br>

<p><span style='color:black'>Owner may remove, edit or reinstate User Content
at our sole discretion.</span></p><br>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>Accessing and Correcting Your Information</span></b></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>You may ask us for a copy of the personal
information we have about you. Generally, we will provide it as long as it is
reasonably retrievable and within our control. You must make your request in
writing. For legal reasons, we may not show you anything we learned as part of
a claim or lawsuit, unless required by law.</span></p><br>

<p><span style='color:black'>If you tell us what we know about you is
incorrect, we will review it. If we agree, we will update our records.
Otherwise, you may dispute our findings in writing, and we will include your
statement whenever we give your disputed information to anyone else.</span></p><br>

<p><b><span style='color:black'>Questions</span></b></p>

<p><span style='color:black'>We want you to understand how we protect your
privacy. If you have any questions about this notice, please contact us. When
you write, include your name, address, and policy or account number.</span></p><br>
